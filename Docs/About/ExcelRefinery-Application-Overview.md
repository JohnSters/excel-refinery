## Application Purpose

**ExcelRefinery** is a specialized web application designed for processing, validating, and analyzing Excel loadsheets containing refinery operational data. The application serves as a comprehensive data quality control and analysis platform for industrial facilities that rely on structured Excel-based data management systems.

### Primary Objectives
- **Data Quality Assurance**: Validate and verify the integrity of Excel-based refinery data
- **Consistency Checking**: Identify inconsistencies, duplicates, and formatting issues
- **File Comparison**: Compare multiple loadsheets to detect changes and discrepancies
- **Data Standardization**: Ensure consistent formatting across all data entries
- **Reporting & Analysis**: Generate insights and reports from processed data

## Target Users

- **Plant Operations Teams** - Upload and validate daily/weekly operational loadsheets
- **Maintenance Coordinators** - Process equipment maintenance and inspection schedules
- **Data Analysts** - Analyze trends and patterns in refinery operational data
- **Quality Control Specialists** - Ensure data consistency and accuracy
- **Management Teams** - Access processed data insights and reports

## Core Functionality

### Data Upload & Processing
ExcelRefinery processes Excel files containing structured refinery data with standardized column headers such as:

#### Standard Column Schema
| Column Name | Description | Data Type |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Equipment ID** | Unique identifier for equipment | Text/Numeric |
| **CMMS System** | Computerized Maintenance Management System reference | Text |
| **Equipment Technical Number** | Technical specification number | Alphanumeric |
| **Task ID** | Unique task identifier | Text/Numeric |
| **Task Type** | Category of task (Inspection, Maintenance, etc.) | Text |
| **Task Description** | Detailed description of the task | Text |
| **Task Details** | Additional task specifications | Text |
| **Last Date** | Date of last completion | Date |
| **Override Interval** | Custom interval overrides | Numeric |
| **Desired Interval** | Standard interval requirements | Numeric |
| **Reoccurring** | Whether task repeats | Boolean |
| **Next Date** | Scheduled next occurrence | Date |
| **Next Date Basis** | Calculation basis for next date | Text |
| **Task Assigned To** | Responsible person/team | Text |
| **Reason** | Justification or notes | Text |
| **Related Entity ID** | Associated entity references | Text/Numeric |

## Supported File Types

### Excel Formats
- **.xlsx** - Modern Excel format (primary support)
- **.xls** - Legacy Excel format (compatibility mode)
- **.csv** - Comma-separated values (limited functionality)

### Multi-Tab Workbooks
- **Full workbook processing** - Handle multiple worksheets within single files
- **Tab-specific analysis** - Process individual sheets separately
- **Cross-tab validation** - Compare data across different sheets
- **Batch processing** - Handle multiple files simultaneously

## Data Processing Capabilities

### 1. Data Validation
- **Schema Validation**: Verify column headers match expected format
- **Data Type Checking**: Ensure data types are correct (dates, numbers, text)
- **Required Field Validation**: Check for missing critical data
- **Format Consistency**: Standardize date formats, number formats, and text casing

### 2. Duplicate Detection
- **Row-level Duplicates**: Identify completely identical rows
- **Key Field Duplicates**: Find duplicates based on critical identifiers
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Detect near-duplicates with minor variations
- **User-controlled Processing**: Allow users to decide how to handle duplicates

### 3. Data Comparison
- **File-to-File Comparison**: Compare two or more loadsheets
- **Version Control**: Track changes between file versions
- **Differential Analysis**: Highlight additions, modifications, and deletions
- **Change Reporting**: Generate reports showing what changed

### 4. Date Processing
- **Date Standardization**: Convert various date formats to consistent format
- **Date Validation**: Verify dates are logical and within expected ranges
- **Interval Calculations**: Calculate next dates based on intervals
- **Calendar Integration**: Handle business days, holidays, and scheduling
